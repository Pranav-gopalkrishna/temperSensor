We need to download and install a library called Adafruit_DHT, provided by Adafruit, into our Raspberry Pi.

(Note: All the following actions are to be done in the terminal, unless stated otherwise)

First, download the library from GitHub. It helps organise your workspace  if you create a folder to place the file in.
------------
Second, download the files related to the library using the function:
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git
All the files downloaded through this will be stored in a directory called Adafruit_Python_DHT. 
You can open this directory through the terminal using:
cd Adafruit_Python_DHT
------------
Third, if you open the directory Adafruit_Python_DHT, you can find a file named setup.py.
Install this file using the command:
sudo python setup.py install
(Side note: sudo ('superuser do') is a command that allows you to run programs with the security privileges of another user.
This is by default the superuser / admin)
------------
Fourth, the code.
As we are using library functions, there is not much to do with regard to programming.

First, include the library functions using the import directive:
import Adadfruit_DHT

Second, import the library sys system functions like print:
import sys

Third, import the time library to use timing functions like the function for suspending the sensor for some specified seconds:
import time

Fourth, use the function for taking the sensory inputs read_retry.
The library function read_retry has the syntax:
humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(sensor, pin)
In our case, the sensor is denoted by 11 and the pin is the GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pin, denoted by 4.
I am not clear with the exact workings, to be honest.
So, the full statement becomes:
humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(11,4)

Fifth, place this function in an infinite loop:
while true
  humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(sensor, pin)

Now, you can print the retrieved and processed values for temperature and humidity, in the same loop of course:
  print 'Temp: {0:0.1f} C  Humidity: {1:0.1f} %'.format(temperature, humidity)

To keep a time gap between each loop cycle, use the sleep function from the time library, in the same loop of course:
  time.sleep(1)
(Note that the value passed to sleep is always in seconds)

Hence, the whole code is:

import sys
import Adafruit_DHT
import time
while True:
    humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(11, 4)
    print 'Temp: {0:0.1f} C  Humidity: {1:0.1f} %'.format(temperature, humidity)
    time.sleep(1)
