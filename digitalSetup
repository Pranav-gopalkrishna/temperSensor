We need to download and install a library called Adafruit_DHT, provided by Adafruit, into our Raspberry Pi.

(Note: All the following actions are to be done in the terminal, unless stated otherwise)

First, download the library from GitHub. It helps organise your workspace  if you create a folder to place the library in.
------------
Second, download the files related to the library using the function:
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git
All the files downloaded through this will be stored in a directory called Adafruit_Python_DHT. 
You can open this directory through the terminal using:
cd Adafruit_Python_DHT
------------
Third, if you open the directory Adafruit_Python_DHT, you can find a file named setup.py.
Install this file using the command:
sudo python setup.py install
(Side note: sudo ('superuser do') is a command that allows you to run programs with the security privileges of another user.
This is by default the superuser / admin)
